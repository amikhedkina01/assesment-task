## Getting Started

The Cypress Real-World App (RWA) is a full-stack Express/React application backed by a local JSON database ([lowdb]).

The app is bundled with [example data](./data/database.json) (`data/database.json`) that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

> ðŸš© **Note**
>
> You can login to the app with any of the [example app users](./data/database.json#L2). The default password for all users is `s3cret`.
> Example users can be seen by running `yarn list:dev:users`.

### Prerequisites

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your machine. Refer to the [.node-version](./.node-version) file for the exact version.

[Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) is also required. Once you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, execute the following to install the npm module [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) (Classic - version 1) globally.

```shell
npm install yarn@latest -g
```

If you have Node.js' experimental [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/corepack.html) feature enabled, then you should skip the step `npm install yarn@latest -g` to install Yarn Classic globally. The RWA project is locally configured for `Corepack` to use Yarn Classic (version 1).

#### Yarn Modern

**This project is not compatible with [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 2 and later).**

### Installation

To clone the repo to your local system and install dependencies, execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app
cd cypress-realworld-app
yarn
```

#### Mac users with M-series chips will need to prepend `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`.

```shell
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true yarn install
```

### Run the app

```shell
yarn dev
```

> ðŸš© **Note**
>
> The app will run on port `3000` (frontend) and `3001` (API backend) by default. Please make sure there are no other applications or services running on both ports.
> If you want to change the default ports, you can do so by modifying `PORT` and `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` variables in `.env` file.
> However, make sure the modified port numbers in `.env` are not committed into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to run on the default ports.

### Start Cypress

```shell
yarn cypress:open
```
